This git repo contains Météo France SingleColumnCoalesced (SCC) transformation based on loki software (https://github.com/ecmwf-ifs/loki).

To run the test, go in build_scc/test and run test.sh, it will apply the transformation on some of the files in build_scc/test/src, and compare the files created with the files in the build_scc/openacc folder.
To run the transformation, go in your pack where you want to apply the transformation, and run build_scc/bin/openacc.sh and build_scc/bin/cpg_dyn_slg.sh.
